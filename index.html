    <p id="hello"> Hello, I am <strong id="name">Tim Schoen</strong>.  Born and Raised outside of Dallas, Texas. <br> No, I did not ride a horse to school.</p>

    <p id="fun-stuff">Growing up I could not get out of the pool.  I absolutely loved it, hence my first job was a life-guard, where I became and instructor for both CPR and First Aid.  I also had a huge passion for avaiotion.   I obtained my pilot's license at the at of 15.  I really enjoy playing golf, but find it extremely frustrating. I love scuba diving,  but when I am underwater I breathe heavy and quickly run out of air. I find hardwork and problem-solving very gratifying.
    </p>

    <p id="other-stuff">I will try everything once.</p>
